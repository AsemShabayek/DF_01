# DF_01
the issue is in two things 
1- the total scale needs to be 100, but not the unit of measure scale (try scaling the main object)
(check also the unit of each id , it can make a difference)
2- rotations of link_3 & link_5 are not correct in the Json file as we tried two different versions of the GLB files and the same issue appeared.
we can also try importing multiple Glb files instead of the single glb.
